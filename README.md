### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

In this challenge i used semantic HTML5 markup for the structure of my webpage and for accessibility, for styling of the
web page i used CSS custom properties and CSS Grid to display the Four Card Feature Secton.

To make the project as responsive as possible i used mobile-first workflow 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>
  <header>
    <p class="reliable">Reliable, efficient delivery</p>
    </header>
</main>
```
```css
:root {
    --clr-primary-red:  hsl(0, 78%, 62%);
}
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

CSS Grid
With CSS Grid i tend to write less css rather than using CSS Flexbox,
Since CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout making layouts would be easier, faster and more responsive.
So for my future projects i would concentrate more on CSS Grid.
